  note={P2P mesh-pull live video streaming applications – such as
                  Cool-Streaming, PPLive, and PPStream – have become
                  popular in the recent years. In this paper, we
                  examine the stream pollution attack, for which the
                  attacker mixes polluted chunks into the P2P
                  distribution, degrading the quality of the rendered
                  media at the receivers. Polluted chunks received by
                  an unsuspecting peer not only effect that single
                  peer, but since the peer also forwards chunks to
                  other peers, and those peers in turn forward chunks
                  to more peers, the polluted content can potentially
                  spread through much of the P2P network.  The
                  contribution of this paper is twofold.  First, by
                  way of experimenting and measuring a popular P2P
                  live video streaming system, we show that the
                  pollution attack can be devastating. Second, we
                  evaluate the applicability of four possible defenses
                  to the pollution attack: blacklisting, traffic
                  encryption, hash verification, and chunk
                  signing. Among these, we conclude that the chunk
                  signing solutions are most suitable.}
