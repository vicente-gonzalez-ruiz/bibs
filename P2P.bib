title={{A push-based scheduling algorithm for large scale P2P live streaming}},
year={2008},
pages={1-7},
abstract={this paper, we present a chunk scheduling algorithm for a mesh-based peer-to-peer live streaming system and we evaluate it by simulations over large-scale networks. Literature papers typically design chunk scheduling algorithms by considering the chunk delivery ratio as performance metric. We propose a push-based algorithm, which not only tries to maximize the chunk delivery ratio but it also takes into account and tries to minimize the delivery delay of chunks at the peer nodes. This is an important requirement, when dealing with realtime multimedia flows. Another important contribution of this paper is the design and implementation of a simulator able to evaluate the performance of large scale P2P networks (tens of thousands peers). The importance of this contribution lies in the fact that existing simulators and performance studies handle at most hundreds or few thousands of peers, while real-life P2P streaming systems aim at distributing contents to several hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users. The performance evaluation study aims at providing a comprehensive view of what performance can be expected for mesh-based peer-to-peer streaming systems, both in terms of chunk delivery ratio and delay, for a large range of the number of users. The individual effect of a variety of system parameters, and especially number of partner nodes in the mesh, constrained link bandwidth, node heterogeneity, and network size, has been analyzed. Our results show that performances of the proposed push-based solution are already quite effective even with severely bandwidth constrained large scale networks.},

  abstract={Peer-to-peer live streaming systems allow a bandwidth-constrained  source  to  broadcast  a  video  feed  to  a  large number of users.  In addition, a design with high link utilization  can  achieve  high  stream  rates,  supporting  high-quality video. Until now, only tree-based designs have been shown to achieve close-to-optimal rates in real-life conditions,  leaving the question open as to the attainable efficiency of completely unstructured mesh-based approaches. In this paper we answer that question by showing that a carefully-designed mesh-based system can achieve close-to-optimal  stream  rates.   Specifically,  we  implement  and evaluate a design based on a mesh-based algorithm called DP/LU. Contrary to tree-based designs, DP/LU uses an unstructured overlay, which is easier to construct and is highly resistant to churn.  In addition, we introduce mechanisms for overlay rewiring and source scheduling that lead to significant performance improvements. Our  experimental  evaluation  shows  that  our  design achieves 95\% of the maximum achievable stream rate in a static environment, and 90\% under high churn. This demonstrates that mesh-based designs are an excellent choice for scalable and robust high-quality peer-to-peer live streaming.}

  abstract={Existing approaches to P2P streaming can be divided into two general classes: (i) tree-based approaches use push-based content delivery over multiple tree-shaped overlays, and (ii) mesh-based approaches use swarming content delivery over a randomly connected mesh. Previous studies have often focused on a particular P2P streaming mechanism and no comparison between these two classes has been conducted. In this paper, we compare and contrast the performance of representative protocols from each class using simulations. We identify the similarities and differences between these two approaches. Furthermore, we separately examine the behavior of content delivery and overlay construction mechanisms for both approaches in static and dynamic scenarios. Our results indicate that the mesh-based approach consistently exhibits a superior performance over the tree-based approach. We also show that the main factors attributing in the inferior performance of the tree-based approach are (i) the static mapping of content to a particular tree, and (ii) the placement of each peer as an internal node in one tree and as a leaf in all other trees.}

In this paper, we first survey CDN-P2P-hybrid architecture technology,

And  then we explore  and analyze  main  issues, including overlay  route  hybrid  issues,  and playing buffer hybrid  ssues.   After that  we  focus  on  CDN-P2P-hybrid model   analysis   and   design,   we   compare the tightly-coupled  hybrid  model  with  the loosely-coupled  hybrid model, and propose that there are some models  which  need  further  study.  At  last,  we  analyze  the prospective  research  direction  and  propose  our  future work.  }
