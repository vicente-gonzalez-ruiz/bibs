  abstract	= {this paper, we present a chunk scheduling algorithm for a
		  mesh-based peer-to-peer live streaming system and we
		  evaluate it by simulations over large-scale networks.
		  Literature papers typically design chunk scheduling
		  algorithms by considering the chunk delivery ratio as
		  performance metric. We propose a push-based algorithm,
		  which not only tries to maximize the chunk delivery ratio
		  but it also takes into account and tries to minimize the
		  delivery delay of chunks at the peer nodes. This is an
		  important requirement, when dealing with realtime
		  multimedia flows. Another important contribution of this
		  paper is the design and implementation of a simulator able
		  to evaluate the performance of large scale P2P networks
		  (tens of thousands peers). The importance of this
		  contribution lies in the fact that existing simulators and
		  performance studies handle at most hundreds or few
		  thousands of peers, while real-life P2P streaming systems
		  aim at distributing contents to several hundreds of
		  thousands, if not millions, of users. The performance
		  evaluation study aims at providing a comprehensive view of
		  what performance can be expected for mesh-based
		  peer-to-peer streaming systems, both in terms of chunk
		  delivery ratio and delay, for a large range of the number
		  of users. The individual effect of a variety of system
		  parameters, and especially number of partner nodes in the
		  mesh, constrained link bandwidth, node heterogeneity, and
		  network size, has been analyzed. Our results show that
		  performances of the proposed push-based solution are
		  already quite effective even with severely bandwidth
		  constrained large scale networks.},

		  content delivery over a randomly connected mesh. Previous
		  studies have often focused on a particular P2P streaming
		  mechanism and no comparison between these two classes has

		  performance of representative protocols from each class
		  using simulations. We identify the similarities and
		  differences between these two approaches. Furthermore, we
		  separately examine the behavior of content delivery and
		  overlay construction mechanisms for both approaches in
		  static and dynamic scenarios. Our results indicate that the
		  mesh-based approach consistently exhibits a superior
		  performance over the tree-based approach. We also show that
		  the main factors attributing in the inferior performance of
		  the tree-based approach are (i) the static mapping of
		  content to a particular tree, and (ii) the placement of
		  each peer as an internal node in one tree and as a leaf in
		  all other trees.}

		  bandwidth-constrained source to broadcast a video feed to a
		  large number of users. In addition, a design with high link
		  utilization can achieve high stream rates, supporting
		  high-quality video. Until now, only tree-based designs have
		  been shown to achieve close-to-optimal rates in real-life
		  conditions, leaving the question open as to the attainable
		  efficiency of completely unstructured mesh-based
		  approaches. In this paper we answer that question by
		  showing that a carefully-designed mesh-based system can
		  achieve close-to-optimal stream rates. Specifically, we
		  implement and evaluate a design based on a mesh-based
		  algorithm called DP/LU. Contrary to tree-based designs,
		  DP/LU uses an unstructured overlay, which is easier to
		  construct and is highly resistant to churn. In addition, we
		  introduce mechanisms for overlay rewiring and source
		  scheduling that lead to significant performance
		  improvements. Our experimental evaluation shows that our
		  design achieves 95\% of the maximum achievable stream rate
		  in a static environment, and 90\% under high churn. This
		  demonstrates that mesh-based designs are an excellent
		  choice for scalable and robust high-quality peer-to-peer
		  live streaming.}
