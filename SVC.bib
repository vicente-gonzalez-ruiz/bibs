  abstract	= {This paper describes a visual optimization strategy for
		  scalable video compression. The challenge scalable coding
		  presents is that truncation of an embedded codestream may
		  induce variable and highly visible distortion. To overcome
		  the deficiencies of visually lossless coding schemes, we
		  propose using an adaptive masking slope to model the
		  perceptual impact of suprathreshold distortion arising from
		  resolution and bit-rate scaling. This allows important
		  scene structures to be better preserved. Following visual
		  masking principles, local sensitivity to distortion is
		  assessed within each frame. To keep the perceptual response
		  uniform against spatiotemporal errors, we mitigate errors
		  compounded by the motion field during temporal synthesis.
		  Visual sensitivity weights are projected into the subband
		  domain along motion trajectories via a process called
		  perceptual mapping. This uses error propagation paths to
		  capture some of the noise-shaping effects attributed to the
		  motion-compensated transform. A key observation is that low
		  contrast regions in the video are generally more
		  susceptible to unmasking of quantization errors. The
		  proposed approach raises the distortion-length slope
		  associated with these critical regions, altering the
		  bitstream embedding order so that visually sensitive sites
		  may be encoded with higher fidelity. Subjective evaluation
		  demonstrates perceptual improvement with respect to
		  bit-rate, spatial and temporal scalability.},
