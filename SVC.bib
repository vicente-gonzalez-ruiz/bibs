  abstract	= { The paper proposes a new framework for the control of the
		  distortion variation in video coding schemes based on
		  motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF). The
		  distortion in an arbitrary decoded frame at any temporal
		  level in the MCTF pyramid is expressed as a function of the
		  distortions in the reference frames at the same temporal
		  level. The approach is formulated for the bi-directional
		  unconstrained MCTF (UMCTF) scheme of Turaga et al., (2002),
		  which does not include the update-lifting step. The
		  proposed framework can be extended to the generalized form
		  of MCTF by utilizing additional control parameters.
		  Experimental results demonstrate the control of the
		  distortion variation in video coding systems based on

  abstract	= {This paper describes a visual optimization strategy for
		  scalable video compression. The challenge scalable coding
		  presents is that truncation of an embedded codestream may
		  induce variable and highly visible distortion. To overcome
		  the deficiencies of visually lossless coding schemes, we
		  propose using an adaptive masking slope to model the
		  perceptual impact of suprathreshold distortion arising from
		  resolution and bit-rate scaling. This allows important
		  scene structures to be better preserved. Following visual
		  masking principles, local sensitivity to distortion is
		  assessed within each frame. To keep the perceptual response
		  uniform against spatiotemporal errors, we mitigate errors
		  compounded by the motion field during temporal synthesis.
		  Visual sensitivity weights are projected into the subband
		  domain along motion trajectories via a process called
		  perceptual mapping. This uses error propagation paths to
		  capture some of the noise-shaping effects attributed to the
		  motion-compensated transform. A key observation is that low
		  contrast regions in the video are generally more
		  susceptible to unmasking of quantization errors. The
		  proposed approach raises the distortion-length slope
		  associated with these critical regions, altering the
		  bitstream embedding order so that visually sensitive sites
		  may be encoded with higher fidelity. Subjective evaluation
		  demonstrates perceptual improvement with respect to
		  bit-rate, spatial and temporal scalability.},

title={Three-dimensional subband coding with motion compensation},

month={Sep},

abstract={Three-dimensional (3-D) frequency coding is an alternative approach to hybrid coding concepts used in today's standards. The first part of this paper presents a study on concepts for temporal-axis frequency decomposition along the motion trajectory in video sequences. It is shown that, if a two-band split is used, it is possible to overcome the problem of spatial inhomogeneity in the motion vector field (MVF), which occurs at the positions of uncovered and covered areas. In these cases, original pixel values from one frame are placed into the lowpass-band signal, while displaced-frame-difference values are embedded into the highpass band. This technique is applicable with arbitrary MVF's; examples with block-matching and interpolative motion compensation are given. Derivations are first performed for the example of two-tap quadrature mirror filters (QMF's), and then generalized to any linear-phase QMF's. With two-band analysis and synthesis stages arranged as cascade structures, higher resolution frequency decompositions are realizable. In the second part of the paper, encoding of the temporal-axis subband signals is discussed. A parallel filterbank scheme was used for spatial subband decomposition, and adaptive lattice vector quantization was employed to approach the entropy rate of the 3-D subband samples. Coding results suggest that high-motion video sequences can be encoded at significantly lower rates than those achievable with conventional hybrid coders. Main advantages are the high energy compaction capability and the nonrecursive decoder structure. In the conclusion, the scheme is interpreted more generally, viewed as a motion-compensated short-time spectral analysis of video sequences, which can adapt to the quickness of changes. Although a 3-D multiresolution representation of the picture information is produced, a true multiresolution representation of motion information, based on spatio-temporal decimation and interpolation of the MVF, is regarded as the still-missing part},

In this new system, spatio-temporal subbands are generated by MC temporal analysis and a spatial wavelet transform, and then encoded by 3-D subband-finite state scalar quantization (3DSB-FSSQ). The rate allocation from the GOP level to each class of subbands is optimized by utilizing the structural property of MC-3DSBC that additive superposition approximately holds for both rate and distortion. The proposed video coding system is applied to several test video clips. Its performance exceeds that of both a known MPEG-1 implementation and a similar subband MC predictive coder while maintaining modest computational complexity and memory size},

abstract={We propose a new framework for highly scalable video compression, using a lifting-based invertible motion adaptive transform (LIMAT). We use motion-compensated lifting steps to implement the temporal wavelet transform, which preserves invertibility, regardless of the motion model. By contrast, the invertibility requirement has restricted previous approaches to either block-based or global motion compensation. We show that the proposed framework effectively applies the temporal wavelet transform along a set of motion trajectories. An implementation demonstrates high coding gain from a finely embedded, scalable compressed bit-stream. Results also demonstrate the effectiveness of temporal wavelet kernels other than the simple Haar, and the benefits of complex motion modeling, using a deformable triangular mesh. These advances are either incompatible or difficult to achieve with previously proposed strategies for scalable video compression. Video sequences reconstructed at reduced frame-rates, from subsets of the compressed bit-stream, demonstrate the visually pleasing properties expected from low-pass filtering along the motion trajectories. The paper also describes a compact representation for the motion parameters, having motion overhead comparable to that of motion-compensated predictive coders. Our experimental results compare favorably to others reported in the literature, however, our principal objective is to motivate a new framework for highly scalable video compression.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a subband adaptive motion
                  compensated temporal filtering (MCTF) technique for
                  scalable video coding and introduces a revised
                  synthesis gain model for the quantization in this
                  adaptive MCTF scheme. In scalable video coding,
                  hierarchical MCTF is extensively adopted to exploit
                  the temporal correlation across video frames. In
                  this hierarchical MCTF structure, the strength of
                  temporal correlation varies with the level of
                  temporal transform and varies with the various
                  spatial frequency components in a frame. The
                  reconstruction noises also have diverse strength at
                  various subbands. According to the correlation and
                  noise characteristics of various subbands, we can
                  adjust the strength of motion compensated prediction
                  step in MCTF to maximally take the advantage of
                  temporal correlation but restrict the propagation of
                  reconstruction noise. The quantization step of each
                  subband is also adjusted according to synthesis gain
                  determined by the MCTF structure. In this way an
                  adaptive MCTF scheme is formed and the proposed
                  technique improves the coding performance of
                  scalable video coding},

abstract={Wavelet-based coding is emerging as a promising framework for efficient and scalable compression of video. Nevertheless, a number of basic tools currently employed in this field have been conceived for hybrid block-based transform coding. This is the case of motion estimation, which generally aims to minimize the energy or the absolute sum of prediction error. However, as wavelet video coders do not employ predictive coding, this is no longer an optimal approach. In this paper we study the problem of the theoretical optimal criterion for wavelet-based video coders, using coding gain as merit figure. A simple solution has been found for a peculiar but useful class of temporal filters. Experiments confirm that the optimally estimated vectors increase the coding gain as well as the performance of a complete video coder, but at the cost of an augmented complexity.},

  abstract	= {This paper describes a visual optimization strategy for
		  scalable video compression. The challenge scalable coding
		  presents is that truncation of an embedded codestream may
		  induce variable and highly visible distortion. To overcome
		  the deficiencies of visually lossless coding schemes, we
		  propose using an adaptive masking slope to model the
		  perceptual impact of suprathreshold distortion arising from
		  resolution and bit-rate scaling. This allows important
		  scene structures to be better preserved. Following visual
		  masking principles, local sensitivity to distortion is
		  assessed within each frame. To keep the perceptual response
		  uniform against spatiotemporal errors, we mitigate errors
		  compounded by the motion field during temporal synthesis.
		  Visual sensitivity weights are projected into the subband
		  domain along motion trajectories via a process called
		  perceptual mapping. This uses error propagation paths to
		  capture some of the noise-shaping effects attributed to the
		  motion-compensated transform. A key observation is that low
		  contrast regions in the video are generally more
		  susceptible to unmasking of quantization errors. The
		  proposed approach raises the distortion-length slope
		  associated with these critical regions, altering the
		  bitstream embedding order so that visually sensitive sites
		  may be encoded with higher fidelity. Subjective evaluation
		  demonstrates perceptual improvement with respect to
		  bit-rate, spatial and temporal scalability.},
