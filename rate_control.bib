abstract={We investigate two important problems in media delivery via active network agents. First, we consider streaming multiple video assets over a shared backbone network through an intermediate proxy-server to a set of receiving clients. The proxy is located at the junction of the backbone network and the last hop to each of the clients and coordinates the delivery of the videos from the origin media server to the clients. We propose an optimization framework that enables the proxy to coordinate the streaming process such that the overall end-to-end performance of the video streams is maximized for the given data rate resources on the backbone and the last hop links. Prospective video quality requirements for the associated media sessions are also taken into consideration in the analysis. Through experiments, we study in detail the operation of the framework and the influence of the various constraints that it considers. Furthermore, we measure its performance gains relative to a sender-driven system where the media server controls the delivery of the data with no assistance from an intervening proxy. We establish an analytical relationship between the relative improvement of the proxy-based system, the network conditions on the backbone and the last hops, and the number of streams served. The gains of the proxy-driven system measured in our experiments closely match their expected values predicted by this relationship. In conjunction with the above scenario, we explore the performance gains due to multi-agent packet scheduling where there are multiple active nodes organizing the packet transmissions along the network path between a server-client pair. To this end, we design an optimization framework that coordinates the multiple scheduling agents such that an end-to-end quality-rate performance metric is maximized. We study experimentally the performance benefits due to multi-agent scheduling relative to single-agent scheduling and conventional server-driven streaming, - - as a function of the number of intermediate nodes at which the packet scheduling is carried out. We quantify analytically the performance gains and match them with high accuracy to the simulation data.},

title={An end-to-end adaptation protocol for layered video multicast using optimal rate allocation}, 
year={2004}, 
volume={6}, 
number={1}, 
pages={87-102}, 
abstract={Layered transmission is a promising solution to video multicast over the heterogeneous Internet. However, since the number of layers is practically limited, noticeable mismatches would occur between the coarse-grained layer subscription levels and the heterogeneous and dynamic rate requirements from the receivers. In this paper, we show that such mismatch can be effectively reduced using a dynamic and fine-grained layer rate allocation on the sender's side. Specifically, we study the optimization criteria for rate allocation, and propose a metric called application-aware fairness index. This metric takes into consideration 1) the nonlinear relation between the perceived video quality and the delivered rate and 2) the degree of satisfaction for receivers with heterogeneous bandwidth requirements. We formulate the rate allocation into an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the expected fairness index for all receivers in a multicast session. We then derive an efficient and scalable solution, and demonstrate that it can be seamlessly integrated into an end-to-end adaptation protocol, called hybrid adaptation layered multicast (HALM). This protocol takes advantage of the emerging fine-grained layered coding, and is fully compatible with the best-effort Internet infrastructure. Simulation and numerical results show that HALM noticeably improves the degree of fairness, and interacts with TCP traffic better than static allocation based protocols. More important, increasing the number of layers in HALM generally improves the degree of fairness; it is sufficient to obtain satisfactory performance with a small number of layers (three to five layers).},

abstract={Rate-distortion (R-D) modeling of video coders has always been an important issue in video streaming; however, few of the traditional R-D models and their performance have been closely examined in the context of scalable (FGS-like) video. To overcome this shortcoming, the first half of the paper models rate-distortion of DCT-based fine-granular scalable coders and derives a simple operational R-D model for Internet streaming applications. Experimental results demonstrate that this R-D result, an extension of the classical R-D formula, is very accurate within the domain of scalable coding methods exemplified by MPEG-4 FGS and H.264 progressive FGS. In the second half of the paper, we examine congestion control and dynamic rate-scaling algorithms that achieve smooth visual quality during streaming using the proposed R-D model. In constant bitrate (CBR) channels, our R-D based quality-control algorithm dramatically reduces PSNR variation between adjacent frames (to less than 0.1 dB in sample sequences). Since the Internet is a changing environment shared by many sources, even R-D based quality control often cannot guarantee nonfluctuating PSNR in variable-bitrate (VBR) channels without the help from an appropriate congestion controller. Thus, we apply recent utility-based congestion control methods to our problem and show how a combination of this approach and our R-D model can benefit future streaming applications},

abstract={In this paper, we derive single layer and scalable video rate and distortion models for video bitstreams encoded using the coarse grain quality scalability (CGS) feature of the scalable extension of H.264/AVC. In these models, we assume the source is Laplacian distributed and compensate for errors in the distribution assumption by linearly scaling the Laplacian parameter . Moreover, we present simplified approximations of the derived models that allow for a run-time calculation of sequence dependent model constants. Our models use the mean absolute difference (MAD) of the prediction residual signal and the encoder quantization parameter (QP) as input parameters. Consequently, we are able to estimate the residual MAD, bitrate, and distortion of a future video frame at any QP value and for both base-layer and CGS layer packets. We also present simulation results that demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed models.},

title={Joint Time-Domain Resource Partitioning, Rate Allocation, and Video Quality Adaptation in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks}, 
year={2015}, 
volume={17}, 
number={5}, 
pages={736-745}, 
abstract={Heterogenous cellular networks (HCN) introduce small cells within the transmission range of a macrocell. For the efficient operation of HCNs it is essential that the high-power macrocell shuts off its transmissions for an appropriate amount of time in order for the low-power small cells to transmit. This is a mechanism that allows time-domain resource partitioning (TDRP) and is critical to be optimized for maximizing the throughput of the complete HCN. In this paper, we investigate video communication in HCNs when TDRP is employed. After defining a detailed system model for video streaming in such an HCN, we consider the problem of maximizing the experienced video quality at all the users, by jointly optimizing the TDRP for the HCN, the rate allocated to each specific user, and the selected video quality transmitted to a user. The NP-hard problem is solved with a primal-dual approximation algorithm that decomposes the problem into simpler subproblems, making them amenable to fast well-known solution algorithms. Consequently , the calculated solution can be enforced in the time scale of real-life video streaming sessions. This last observation motivates the enhancement of the proposed framework to support video delivery with dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH). Our extensive simulation results demonstrate clearly the need for our holistic approach for improving the video quality and playback performance of the video streaming users in HCNs.},
