  abstract	= { The paper proposes a new framework for the control of the
		  distortion variation in video coding schemes based on
		  motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF). The
		  distortion in an arbitrary decoded frame at any temporal
		  level in the MCTF pyramid is expressed as a function of the
		  distortions in the reference frames at the same temporal
		  level. The approach is formulated for the bi-directional
		  unconstrained MCTF (UMCTF) scheme of Turaga et al., (2002),
		  which does not include the update-lifting step. The
		  proposed framework can be extended to the generalized form
		  of MCTF by utilizing additional control parameters.
		  Experimental results demonstrate the control of the
		  distortion variation in video coding systems based on
		  spatial-domain and wavelet-domain MCTF. One concludes that
		  the proposed framework provides the means of controlling
		  the tradeoff between the average distortion and the
		  distortion variation in each group-of-pictures (GOPs)
		  within the decoded sequence.},
