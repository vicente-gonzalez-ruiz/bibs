  abstract={High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is currently being
                  prepared as the newest video coding standard of the
                  ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group and the ISO/IEC
                  Moving Picture Experts Group. The main goal of the
                  HEVC standardization effort is to enable
                  significantly improved compression performance
                  relative to existing standards-in the range of 50\%
                  bit-rate reduction for equal perceptual video
                  quality. This paper provides an overview of the
                  technical features and characteristics of the HEVC
                  standard.},
